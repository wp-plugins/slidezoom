== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Do I need to download HighSlide JS or do somethings on WordPress's theme ? =

SlideZoom is Plug & Play plugin. 
You don't have to do anything at HighSlide JS Script , SlideZoom already hook up the script. And nothing to do about WordPress's theme. 
After you copy & paste the HTML Code in the textbox and publish the posts, HighSlide's script will load automatically.

= What happen if same filename is exist in my images folder? Will it be overwrite? =

No, if filename is same, newer file will be append a number as new filename.It apply on both classic file upload or zip upload.

= Any foot print ? =

The only foot print is SlideZoom need to write one line to WP database's options table , this line named : [slidezoom_options].
If you want keep your wp database clean , simple delete that line after deactivate.

= What happen after i deactivate SlideZoom, the images will lost on post/page ? =

SlideZoom is 100% flexible! After you deactivate the plugin , the thumbs/images you generated will keep in post/page. And the size will be retain.
What you lost is HighSlide effect.

= Your english look bad ? Why? =

Because i come from HongKong , I speak Chinese :)
